//! Shared domain for the governance platform: the tenant/application/integration
//! registry, credential issuance and the provider-agnostic normalized model that
//! every connector writes into (ADR-0005).
//!
//! Persistence is **cratestack only** (ADR-0009). `schema/governance.cstack` is
//! the source of truth for the tables, the migrations, the CRUD layer and the
//! REST routes; `include_server_schema!` expands it below. There is no
//! hand-written SQL in this workspace -- anything the generated CRUD cannot
//! express goes in a schema `procedure`, never in a second persistence path.
//!
//! Money is ALWAYS integer micro-USD (ADR-0008). There is no float in this crate.
