//! The `ExternalProcessor` gRPC service.
//!
//! Two directions, two shapes, matching ADR-0116's split:
//!
//! - **Request** — walked once the whole JSON body is available (the
//!   `EnvoyExtensionPolicy` sets `processingMode.request.body: Buffered`, so
//!   Envoy hands us exactly one `RequestBody` message covering the whole
//!   payload). Identical logic to `redact-gateway`'s request path, since the
//!   input shape is identical.
//! - **Response** — Envoy's `processingMode.response.body: Streamed` sends
//!   *every* response through this path, not only genuine SSE completions:
//!   `stream: false` completions and embeddings responses arrive the same
//!   way, in chunks. Which of the two shapes a given response actually has
//!   is resolved from the upstream `Content-Type` header (see
//!   [`ResponseState::set_mode_from_headers`]) into one of two handling
//!   modes:
//!   - **SSE** (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`): scanned incrementally via
//!     [`governance_redact::SseHoldBack`] as chunks arrive, so output lags
//!     input by a bounded window rather than by the length of the
//!     completion. `SseHoldBack` is frame-aware: it extracts `delta.content`
//!     and every tool call's `function.arguments` before redacting anything
//!     (the same rule [`governance_redact::scan_sse`]'s buffered path uses)
//!     and snaps every release to a whole SSE frame boundary, so a redaction
//!     operator's replacement can never land partway through a frame's JSON
//!     — the front-proxy-era limitation this module used to carry (a
//!     raw-byte [`governance_redact::HoldBack`] with no notion of SSE
//!     structure) is closed.
//!   - **Buffered** (anything else, including a missing or unrecognised
//!     Content-Type): accumulated in full and scanned in one pass at
//!     `end_of_stream`, mirroring `redact-gateway`'s non-streaming response
//!     path. This is the fail-closed default — `SseHoldBack` only ever
//!     examines `data:` lines, so feeding it a plain JSON body (because SSE
//!     was wrongly assumed) would release every byte as
//!     `Frame::Passthrough` with zero calls to `engine.scan`. That was a
//!     real gap: prior to this mode existing, every non-SSE response body
//!     ext_proc's `Streamed` setting handed us went out completely
//!     unscanned. An ambiguous Content-Type buffers rather than streams —
//!     "unknown" routes to the branch that inspects the whole body before
//!     releasing anything, not to the one that assumes it is safe to
//!     stream through.
//!
//! A response chunk boundary landing mid-UTF-8 codepoint (SSE mode only —
//! the buffered mode hands raw bytes straight to `serde_json`, which does
//! its own UTF-8 validation over the complete body) is handled by carrying
//! the incomplete trailing bytes over to the next chunk (see
//! [`decode_chunk_with_carry`]) rather than failing the request — this is
//! a routine consequence of chunked delivery, not evidence of anything
//! wrong with the content, and treating it as an error broke nearly every
//! short completion in production (2026-08-03): upstream framing put a
//! multi-byte character at a fixed offset that split on almost every
//! reply, not on some rare unlucky one.
