//! The `ExternalProcessor` gRPC service.
//!
//! Two directions, two shapes, matching ADR-0116's split:
//!
//! - **Request** — walked once the whole JSON body is available (the
//!   `EnvoyExtensionPolicy` sets `processingMode.request.body: Buffered`, so
//!   Envoy hands us exactly one `RequestBody` message covering the whole
//!   payload). Identical logic to `redact-gateway`'s request path, since the
//!   input shape is identical.
//! - **Response** — scanned incrementally via
//!   [`governance_redact::SseHoldBack`] as chunks arrive under
//!   `processingMode.response.body: Streamed`, so output lags input by a
//!   bounded window rather than by the length of the completion.
//!   `SseHoldBack` is frame-aware: it extracts exactly `delta.content` before
//!   redacting anything (the same rule
//!   [`governance_redact::scan_sse`]'s buffered path uses) and snaps every
//!   release to a whole SSE frame boundary, so a redaction operator's
//!   replacement can never land partway through a frame's JSON — the
//!   front-proxy-era limitation this module used to carry (a raw-byte
//!   [`governance_redact::HoldBack`] with no notion of SSE structure) is
//!   closed.
//!
//! A response chunk boundary landing mid-UTF-8 codepoint is handled by
//! carrying the incomplete trailing bytes over to the next chunk (see
//! [`decode_chunk_with_carry`]) rather than failing the request — this is
//! a routine consequence of chunked delivery, not evidence of anything
//! wrong with the content, and treating it as an error broke nearly every
//! short completion in production (2026-08-03): upstream framing put a
//! multi-byte character at a fixed offset that split on almost every
//! reply, not on some rare unlucky one.
