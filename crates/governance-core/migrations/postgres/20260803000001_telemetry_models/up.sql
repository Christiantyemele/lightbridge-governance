-- Telemetry models: executions, model_calls, tool_calls, model_pricing (#30)
--
-- All money is micro-USD (ADR-0008). All writes are idempotent on (trace_id, span_id).
-- `tenant_id` is derived from the authenticated credential, never from the telemetry body.

-- NOTE: the following column(s) use `@default(dbgenerated())`, a marker meaning
-- the value is expected to come from a real Postgres-level default set some other
-- way (hand-authored SQL, a trigger, GENERATED ... AS IDENTITY, etc). cratestack
-- does not emit a DEFAULT clause for it. Added by hand here, same as the init
-- migration's `applications`/etc (#18) -- without it every create through the
-- generated CRUD 500s on a NOT NULL violation:
--   - executions.created_at / updated_at
--   - model_calls.created_at / updated_at
--   - tool_calls.created_at / updated_at
--   - model_pricing.created_at / updated_at / effective_from
